      <p>Hi my name is Jake brown and this is my online portfolio. I use this website to upload my pet projects such as games I might be working on during my free time.</p>

      <p>I am currently training as a junior consultant working for <a href="https://www.spartaglobal.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwtMvlBRDmARIsAEoQ8zQFVpCZPd7H9rLH4n4xIXmWW0muKltfasGJIiZfkL0lhRxaaJZ2P3kaAgGWEALw_wcB">Sparta Global.</a> Before working for Sparta I spent a few years working as a bartender for various companies.</p>

      <p>Through most of my education I mainly focused on studying IT as I spent most of my life surrounded by computers and most of my free time either on my dads computer or games console.</p>
